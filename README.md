# Introduction

We are introducing **COCO LLM**, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) specifically designed with knowledge of mainframe legacy systems and COBOL codebases. COCO LLM is built on top of DeepSeek-Coder 7B and is available with 7B and 10.5B parameters. Additionally, we have created COCO bench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing mainframe knowledge, including multiple-choice questions, question answering, and COBOL code summarization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that COCO LLM consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLMs across these tasks. Specifically, COCO LLM achieves 30% higher accuracy than DeepSeek-Coder on multiple-choice questions, doubles the BLEU score of Mixtral-Instruct 8x7B on question answering, and scores six times higher than GPT-3.5 on COBOL summarization. Our work highlights the potential of COCO LLM to drive significant advancements in managing and modernizing legacy systems, thereby enhancing productivity and saving time for software developers.

# Demonstration

In this section, we demonstrate the capabilities of COCO LLM by comparing it with the leading language model, DeepSeek-Coder-7B. We evaluate the performance of each model by showcasing their responses to a series of realistic questions related to mainframe knowledge. The images below illustrate how each model handles identical prompts. As shown, the responses generated by COCO LLM are not only accurate but also more detailed and comprehensive compared to those from the base model, DeepSeek-Coder-7B. This makes COCO LLM particularly valuable for developers seeking a reliable and thorough AI assistant in the mainframe environment.
